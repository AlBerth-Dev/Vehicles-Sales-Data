# Vehicles-Sales-Data

The vehicles_us.csv file is a dataset with information on vehicles for sale. This project aims to build a web application to be able to filter and view the dataset information in a simpler way, so that data can be presented according to the users' requirements.


The web application allows to see the characteristics of the vehicles based on the values indicated by the odometer, such as the price or condition of the vehicles.

It also shows a bar graph with the different available types of vehicles offered by different manufacturers. As well as a histogram showing the condition of the vehicles according to their year of release.

Finally, the application can compare the price distribution that the different manufacturers use for their vehicles.

The project main directory includes:
- A Jupyter notebook, where data preparation and data wrangling are done.
- A python script, app.py, used to build the project using streamlit.
- A streamlit directory, where it is stablished the necesary configuration for the use of streamlit and render.
- requirements.txt file, where the necesary resources for web app deploy in render platform are specified.
